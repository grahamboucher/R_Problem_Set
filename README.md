This is the R Module for the Dennis Lab for onboarding of new students/trainees/employees.

There are three challenges that build on the work of each of the previous challenges. The goal of these challenges is to develop a baseline for R proficiencies amongst lab members.

Also included is some completed code that works through each of the challenges. As can be seen, there is no singlular solution to each challenge and they serve as an example of the different ways to tackle a problem.

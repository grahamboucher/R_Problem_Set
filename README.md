Dennis Lab problem set for R

This is the introduction module to R

First, you'll need to ensure that you have the following items:

RStudio

Second, there are three (currently) challenge problem sets that attempt to provide an introduction to R. There are no deliverable at the end of each problem set.

Problem_Set_1's Goal: Loading in files in R, doing some basic QC and generating plots
Problem_Set_2's Goal: Building on PS1, this problem set looks to generate simple statistical measures and create new variables based on logical conditions.
Problem_Set_3's Goal: PS3 aims to expand on PS2 by automating some of the decisions to classify the data and the subsequent output.

Dennis Lab problem set for R

This is the introduction module to R

First, you'll need to ensure that you have the following items:

RStudio

Second, there are four challenge problem sets that attempt to provide an introduction to R. There are no deliverable at the end of the first three problem set but rather you should work through them to ensure that you are comfortable.

Problem_Set_1's Goal: Loading in files in R, doing some basic QC and generating plots
Problem_Set_2's Goal: Building on PS1, this problem set looks to generate simple statistical measures and create new variables based on logical conditions.
Problem_Set_3's Goal: PS3 aims to expand on PS2 by automating some of the decisions to classify the data and the subsequent output.

Problem_Set_4's Goal: This problem set will have you create a continegency table, calculate OR, and use a statistical test on SNPs that match between GWAS and eQTL/mQTL

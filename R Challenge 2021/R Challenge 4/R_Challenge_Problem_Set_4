R_Challenge_Problem_Set_4

This problem set aims to get you used to reading in some real data, cleaning it, and generating some simple results. 

!You may want to try running this through the R Singularity on Sockeye!

1. Read in GWAS Data
  a. Location of GWAS data
  Hint: *Look at different ways to read in data (data.table package may be useful here)
2. Read in annotation files (mQTL & eQTL)
  a. Peng - Cis & Trans eQTL in placenta pdf
  b. Delahaye - Excel file journal.pgen.1007785.s018.xlsx
  Hint: Similar to step 1, you may want to look at different packages to assist in reading in the data
3. Perform QC on data
  a. Remove copy number variants (CNV's) and multi-allelic SNPs
4. Create a 2X2 table that looks at SNP's that match from GWAS / annotations and that meet p<1e-5 threshold
5. Calculate odds ratio and confidence intervals using contingency table created in 3
6. Choose a statistical test to determine significance of association

Findings:
1. Discuss findings with you mentor (e.g. choice of statistical test, what the 2X2 and odds ratio tell you)

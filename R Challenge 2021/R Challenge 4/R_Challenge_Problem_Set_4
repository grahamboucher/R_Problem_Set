R_Challenge_Problem_Set_4

This problem set aims to get you used to reading in some real data, cleaning it, and generating some simple results.

We are going to be using the data on Autism Spectrum Disorder from J Grove et al's paper "Identification of common genetic risk variants for autism spectrum disorder" (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6454898/)

1. Read in GWAS Data
  a. Get the ASD sumstats from https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/asd2019/14671989?file=28169289
  Hint: *Look at different ways to read in data (data.table package may be useful here)
2. Read in annotation files (mQTL & eQTL)
  a. Peng - Cis & Trans eQTL in placenta pdf
  b. Delahaye - Excel file journal.pgen.1007785.s018.xlsx
  Hint: Similar to step 1, you may want to look at different packages to assist in reading in the data
3. Perform QC on data
  a. Remove copy number variants (CNV's) and multi-allelic SNPs
4. Create a contingency table that looks at SNP's that match from GWAS / annotations and that meet p<1e-5 threshold
5. Calculate odds ratio and confidence intervals using contingency table you created
6. Choose a statistical test to determine significance of association

Findings:
1. Discuss findings with you mentor (e.g. choice of statistical test, what the 2X2 and odds ratio tell you)
